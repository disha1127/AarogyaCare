Issues to Fix:
1️⃣ Diet Plan Should Provide Actual Results

The current diet plan feature does not generate meaningful, personalized meal recommendations.

Ensure that the diet plan provides real meal suggestions based on:

User's region (suggest foods available locally).

Medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).

Allergies (avoid triggering ingredients).

Dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, keto, high-protein, etc.).

Nutritional value (calories, proteins, fats, carbs).

Ensure data is fetched from a structured dataset (not placeholders) and works offline.

2️⃣ Replace Keyholders with Proper Header Names

Many sections are showing keys instead of actual labels (e.g., home("hi") returned an object instead of string).

Fix all translation-related issues so that:

Proper headings appear instead of key placeholders.

All labels, buttons, and sections have meaningful human-readable text.

The translation files return strings, not objects.

3️⃣ Fix Navigation: Each Feature Must Have a Working Route

Ensure that all homepage features are correctly linked to their respective pages.

Fix broken links so that clicking on:

Symptom Checker → Navigates to /symptom-checker

Diet Plan → Navigates to /diet-plans

Medication Reminder → Navigates to /medication-reminders

Health Articles → Navigates to /health-articles

Government Schemes → Navigates to /government-schemes

Hospital Finder → Navigates to /hospital-finder

Ensure Next.js routing works properly with correct paths and no 404 errors.

4️⃣ Ensure Multilingual Support Works Properly

Fix all translation issues to support multiple languages.

Ensure that:

The language switcher updates the entire application dynamically.

No broken translations or missing keys.

Multilingual support works offline by storing translations locally.

Expected Outcome:
✅ A fully functional diet plan that gives real, region-based meal recommendations.
✅ Readable headers instead of key placeholders for all sections.
✅ Properly working routers for every homepage feature, without broken links.
✅ Multilingual support that dynamically updates text across the application.
